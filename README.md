##description & motivation

description: This website was made for a fictional candy shop e-commerce. The goal was to have a fun and colorful design. This was accomplished by using different colors such as pink, purple and teal and with a logo representing a whale splashing sprinkles.

The vision with this website was to create an e-commerce that would sell home-made vegan candies that are made with love and natural quality ingredients. Candies should be offered in a large variety of flavors and have multiple unusual ones. As a candy lover, I thought this was a great opportunity.
